# BBScan

This is a utility demonstrating the use of the ContexIO API to examine
emails in an inbox and parse out friend notifications from a
hypothetical BitBuddy.com coder friends website. Emails of note have a
subject line of `New Friends On BitBiddy.com!` (sic).

Inside those messages there are HTML-formatted sections enumerating the 
friends that have been added.

This gem installs a command-line tool called `bbscan` that will check
the mailbox and print out a list of friends.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bbscan'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bbscan

## Usage

Before you begin, you need to create add the following variables to 
your environment: `CIO_KEY`, `CIO_SECRETE`, `BBS_MAIL`. The first two
are self-explanatory; the third is the email address that BitBuddy.com
is delivering the friend notifications to.

The easiest way to do this is to add a `.env` file to your 
project/home directory with the following:

```bash
CIO_KEY=<YOUR_CONTEXTIO_KEY>
CIO_SECRET=<YOUR_CONTEXTIO_SECRET>
BBS_MAIL=<YOUR_EMAIL_ACCT>
```

Then you can use the `bbscan` command like so:

```bash
$ bbscan
